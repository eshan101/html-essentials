# HTML Essentials

Welcome to **HTML Essentials**! 🎉 This repository is designed to help you master HTML, starting from the basics and progressing to advanced concepts. Whether you're a beginner looking to get started or someone brushing up on their skills, this repository will guide you through each step of the journey.

## 📖 About the Repository

Each folder in this repository is numbered in sequence, making it easy to follow along. As you go through them in order, you'll build a strong foundation and gradually dive into more advanced topics.

But we don't stop at theory! We highly encourage you to try coding alongside each section. Replicating the code and experimenting with it will help solidify your understanding and ensure that the knowledge sticks with you for the long term.

## 🛠 How to Use

1. **Start from the Beginning:** Each folder is numbered, so begin with folder `html_lesson_1` and follow the path forward.
2. **Experiment:** As you go through the examples, replicate the code on your local machine. Feel free to tweak and play around to truly understand how HTML works.
3. **Learn by Doing:** The best way to learn HTML is by doing. Don't just read—code! You'll understand the concepts better, and it will become second nature in no time.
